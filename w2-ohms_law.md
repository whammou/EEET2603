# Power Energy Resistor and Ohm's Law


## 0. Electric Energy Conversion

*"The first law of thermodynamics state that. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be transformed from one to another"*

- In practice, the electric energy is often converted into/from other forms of energy

## 1. Electrical Power


- Electrical power (P) is the rate of change in electric energy respected to time

$$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$$

$$P = \frac{W}{t} \text{ if } P = \text{ const }$$

> [!NOTE]
> Q is the total charges passing through the device in time (t)
> $$P = \left(\frac{W}{Q} \right) \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{t}\right)$$
> Thus, $P = V \cdot I$

- Unit of electric power is **Watts (W)**

$$1 \text{ Watt } = \frac{1 \text{Joule}}{1 \text{second}} = 1 \text{Volt} \cdot 1 \text{Ampere}$$

- Electric energy (E or W) is the electric power consumed or generated over a period of time

$$W = \int P \times t$$

or $E = P \times t$ if P = const
