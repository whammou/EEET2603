## 0. Resistive Circuit


A circuit that contains only a pure resistance (ohms) in an AC circuit is called a Purely Resistive AC Circuit. From a technical standpoint, this circuit does not contain capacitance or inductance


## 1. Circuit Simplification for Resistive Network


- This method is normally applied for the [resistive circuit](#0-resistive-circuit) with only one electrical source
- The *series* or *parallel* network between two nodes can be represented by one equivalent resistance
- Applying [Ohm's Law](./LEC_02.md#3-ohms-law) to find the current of the series network or the voltage of parallel network
