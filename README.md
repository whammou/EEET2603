# Introduction to Electrical & Electronic Engineering Outline


- Lectures are taught by [Dr. Bui Xuan Minh](minh.buixuan@rmit.edu.vn). The ultimate objectives of the course are; To introduce fundamental principles and concepts of electrical and electronics circuits; to equip knowledge and experience to analyse and build fundamental electrical and electronic circuits for practical application
  - **Lecture 1:** [Electrical Quantities](./w1-electrical_quantities.md): Introduce the course with the course learning outcome, topics to be covered, course learning activity. We also start the first topic relate to fundamental electric quantities
  - **Lecture 2:** [Power, Energy, Resistor and Ohm's Law](./w2-ohms_law.md): Study the main electrical concepts and practical use of electrical components
  - **Lecture 3:** [Electric Circuit and Kirchhoff's Law](./w3-kirchoffs_law.md): Main concepts of electric circuit and the Kirchhoff's laws to analyze the electric circuits
